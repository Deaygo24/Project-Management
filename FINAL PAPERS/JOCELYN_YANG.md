[Comment_1]: <> (begin your text here)

For Chicagoans, urban waterfronts like the ones lining Chicago's Lake Michigan, are treasured public spaces that give residents a place for recreation, relax, and enjoy the city. As valued as these beaches are however, the water quality of these beaches can fluctuate rapidly because of factors like stormwater runoff, bacterial contamination, and environmental shift, posing risks to public safety and health to residents and visitors. For this reason, timely and easily-accessible information about beach conditions and water quality is highly important and essential in order to help residents and visitor make informed decisions about where and when they want to visit these beaches and take a swim. 

The WaterQuality Ranker project is aimed at addressing this need of information by providing an interactive data dashboard that visualizes water quality trends across the city's beaches. Built using publicly available data from the Chicago city data portal, and intuitive design principles, the platform is designed to inform residents, or other users whether they are environmental researchers or public health officials, to explore historical and real-time data on E. coli levels, swim advisories, and seasonal trends. 

This project is more than just a data visualization tool. It also represents an effort to bridge open data with public engagement, promoting environmental transparency, and enhance community awareness generally around a significant issue that impacts millions of residents and visitors during Chicago's summer months. Through the integratoin of data analysis, user-centered design, and accessible articles, this profect will contribute to smarter urban-decision making and healthier waterfront use.
