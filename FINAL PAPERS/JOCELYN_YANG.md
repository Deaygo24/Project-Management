### Introduction   

[Comment_1]: <> (begin your text here)

For Chicagoans, urban waterfronts like the ones lining Chicago's Lake Michigan, are treasured public spaces that give residents a place for recreation, relax, and enjoy the city. As valued as these beaches are however, the water quality of these beaches can fluctuate rapidly because of factors like stormwater runoff, bacterial contamination, and environmental shift, posing risks to public safety and health to residents and visitors. For this reason, timely and easily-accessible information about beach conditions and water quality is highly important and essential in order to help residents and visitor make informed decisions about where and when they want to visit these beaches and take a swim. 

The WaterQuality Ranker project is aimed at addressing this need of information by providing an interactive data dashboard that visualizes water quality trends across the city's beaches. Built using publicly available data from the Chicago city data portal, and intuitive design principles, the platform is designed to inform residents, or other users whether they are environmental researchers or public health officials, to explore historical and real-time data on E. coli levels, swim advisories, and seasonal trends. 

This project is more than just a data visualization tool. It also represents an effort to bridge open data with public engagement, promoting environmental transparency, and enhance community awareness generally around a significant issue that impacts millions of residents and visitors during Chicago's summer months. Through the integratoin of data analysis, user-centered design, and accessible articles, this profect will contribute to smarter urban-decision making and healthier waterfront use.

### Project Motivation and Goals

The motivation behind the WaterQuality Ranker project comes from the growing concern about the accessiblity and transparency of environmental health data in urban spaces. One of the biggest for me when I consider someplace "clean" or not, will be the quality of the water and the clearness of the water. I want this project to address this concern. This is why as a frequency visitor to Chicago's beaches, I noticed that it is hard to find accurate and recent information the water quality, esepcially during periods of heavy rain or high lake activity. While the City of Chicago does publish public accesible data, it is often in .csv format, making it highly unreadable for the public or those not familiar with csv formats. This gap in usability between data scientists and the general public inspired me to build a tool that could help make vital information such as this one more approachable for the general public and engaging so the community could understand as well.

Public awareness of beach safety is not only a matter of personal convenience, but it's also a public health issue. According to the EPA, elevated E. coli levels in recreational waters can lead to increased rates of illnesses, particularly among children and immunocompromised individuals. By creating this project, it becomes a platform that makes it easy to understand the potential dangers of the beach water and water safety, allowing the community to make smart choices and potentially avoid harmful exposure.

The overarching goal of this project is to transform raw environmental data into an accessible and informative experience for the user, specifically including:

 * visualizing historical E. coli data from Chicago's beaches in an intuitive dashboard
 * highlighting temporal trends, such as seasonal or weekday/weekend fluctuations in water quality
 * supporting public health advocacy and city planning by showing patterns in swim advisories
 * encouraging a broader conversation around urban environmental health and the role of open data

Ultimately, this project will aim to make environmental data actionable and use community-centered tools and designs to promote a safer, more informed use of shared public spaces.
