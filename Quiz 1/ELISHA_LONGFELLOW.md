|--------------|---------|-------------------|
|Alabama| <li> 4 years old <li> Doesn't have an actual birthday so I made his the day before mine <li> Around this time last year, Alabama had a urinal blockage that almost took his life. Male cats are super prone to this condition so make sure yours gets plenty of water! <li> When I adopted him, they told me that he was a cat off the street who wandered into a hotel and just vibed. Not sure how true that is. <li> Very lazy <li> Favorite place to sleep is the foot of my bed <li> Pretends he doesn't like me and doesn't want attention but always follows me around or crosses in front of me just to roll over so I pet his stomach. <li> Rarely meows </li> | ![alabama](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505328222012178435/1337915563950997555/IMG_4724.jpg?ex=67a92e77&is=67a7dcf7&hm=b8646b0d8d0ef0609ef0eea7ae15b33c6b8acd121ee8451fed54cc7e2e450bbe&)
|Blake| <li> 2 years old <li> Scared of the laundry basket <li> Enjoys laying on top of me <li> The most vocal of the three. Will start yelling when he's hungry <li> In the right lighting, you can see brown in his fur <li> Will purr if you so much as look at him <li> An absolute angel <li> Yang's brother </li> | ![blake](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505328222012178435/1337915565376929812/IMG_3166.jpg?ex=67a92e78&is=67a7dcf8&hm=4c65d7229e71f00787f179dc6e04ddbd36d3433f9982adcfe4e9345b2c012001&)
