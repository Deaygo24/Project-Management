# Hello, I'm Jade Carthans!
It is great to meet everyone! I am excited to take IS 340, I am excited to get more experience GitHub and learn more about Project Management. 
I am Junior in Information Sciences. (Fun Fact: I have experience from a range of fields - UX design, data science, software engineering, etc. I always love to learn something new.)

### My favorite movies & tv shows are:

| **Languages to Learn**  | **Difficulty** | **Personal Experience** |
| --------- | ----- | ------------ |
| Java   | Intermediate  | Java is a great language, but the format and syntax of the language is what makes it more complex.  |
| HTML/CSS      | Easy  | HTML/CSS is easy to learn and it is very straight-forward in what the code means. I feel like anyone can read it without a technical background.   |
| SQL | Intermediate  | SQL is a language to learn later in your technical background. It is a part of the back-end of learning about database management and design.
| Python | Easy  | Python is a very intutive language. It is a great starter language and it is has many applications from data science, software engineering to front-end. I would highly recommend to learn.
