Here is a table of design softwares/tools I use!

| **Software Name**  | **Level of Expertise** | **Would I recommend?** |
| --------- | ----- | ------------ |
| Figma   | Intermediate  | For UX Design, Figma is amazing. It is the industry standard for designing web and mobile user experiences because of it's versatility.  |
| Miro      | Intermediate  | Miro is a great space to synthesize interview results and conduct brainstorming.   |
| FigJam | Intermediate  | Figjam is similar to Miro, but it can be more interoperable since it can be easily integrated with Figma. It is especially useful to create information architecture diagrams.    |
